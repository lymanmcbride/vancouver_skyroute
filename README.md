# vancouver_skyroute
The Vancouver Skyroute project is a tool for finding metro-navigation between lanmarks in Vancouver. The skyroute file takes the information from the landmarks and metro dictionaries, and utilizes graph search algorithms to create a program which does the following:

    - Prompts the user for input regarding where they are and where they want to go.

    - Uses the input to find the closest stations and the fastest metro route between landmarks

    - Allows for an administrator to close metro stations that are under construction

To test out the code, just make sure you download all necessary files: skyroute.py, graph_search.py, vc_metro.py, vc_landmarks.py, landmark_choices.py. Run skyroute.py in the terminal and enjoy finding directions in Vancouver!
