# Vancouver Skyroute
The Vancouver Skyroute project is a tool for finding metro-navigation between lanmarks in Vancouver. The skyroute file takes the information from the landmarks and metro dictionaries, and utilizes graph search algorithms to create a program which does the following:
- Prompts the user for input regarding where they are and where they want to go.
- Uses the input to find the closest stations and the fastest metro route between landmarks
- Allows for an administrator to close metro stations that are under construction
